## Version 1.2:

* Allow users to customize the default NxN grid size
  for the jigsaw puzzle

* Bug fix in calculating the size of the jigsaw frame
  In some corner cases, frame size was too small or
  too large.

------------------------------

## Version 1.1:

* Minor bug fix; when a piece is clicked on but not moved,
  its position offsets depending on where it is clicked.
  This can sometimes cause an ugly gap between this piece
  and its immediate attached neighbors.  Fixed this error.

* Updated copyright notices
